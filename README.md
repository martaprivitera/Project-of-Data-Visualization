## Flights History

The air technology has greatly increased in recent decades becoming one of the first mean of movement from one place to another. 
People have the possibility to access advanced, more comfortable form of transport and speed connections between cities. 
For this reason, it is natural to think that the number of passengers is growing over the years. 
To support that claim, we find the analysis on the evolution of passenger numbers in world history made by The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
The curve of passenger numbers turns out almost exponentially, undergoing an unprecedented decline just in 2020 with the advent of the pandemic Covid 19.

Specific Questions: 

- How has air traffic industry been developed across the last decades? What and how has changed with COVID-19 impact?

- Were this changes different across the continents?

- Were there other important trends to be analysed?

In order to answer questions of interest, we worked with four different data sets: Airlines Traffic Passenger Statistics (Kaggle), Air transport of passengers (Eurostat), COVID-19 Air Traffic Data (OpenSky), Air traffic for each airport in the world (OpenSky).
The Goal of the analysis is to present an infographic that shows the change in the number of aircraft passengers and the number of flights over the years. 
We want to understand how these numbers are changing and how the pandemic has affected their evolution over time. 
We also intend to go into detail and represent the differences in flights between states during the pre and post COVID period. 
We believe that this project allowed us to learn on a professional level how to deal with a new tool such as Tableau, but above all to delve into a field that was new to us, the data processing and data representation.

## Content

This repository contains the Flights History project we developed using Tableau:

- The downloadable file, Flights history.twbx, includes several interactive dashboards, which can also be accessed at the following link:

[Flights History Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marta.privitera/viz/Flightshistory/Flightshistory?publish=yes)

These dashboards were designed to address our research questions.

- A PDF containing our project report has also been added to this repository for completeness.

### This project was created in collaboration with Alice Parodi and Luca Cilloni, fellow students at the University of Milano-Bicocca.
